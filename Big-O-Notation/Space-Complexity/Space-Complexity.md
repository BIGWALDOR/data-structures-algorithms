# Space Complexity

## Summary

- Space complexity is the focus of this discussion, which refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as the input size increases.

- Time complexity, discussed previously, focuses on the runtime of algorithms.

- Auxiliary space complexity excludes the space taken up by inputs, focusing solely on the algorithm's space requirements.

- As N grows, the size of the input itself is ignored, and attention is directed towards the algorithm's space usage.

- Most primitives like booleans and numbers occupy constant space, regardless of the input size.

- Strings and reference types (arrays and objects) require O(n) space, where n is the length or number of keys.

- A function example called "sum" demonstrates constant space complexity since it only uses a fixed number of variables.

- Another function example called "double" has space complexity proportional to the input size, resulting in O(n) space.

- Understanding space complexity alongside time complexity helps evaluate algorithm performance.

- Mastery of space complexity is not necessary at this point, but it's helpful for comparing algorithms' space and time complexities.
