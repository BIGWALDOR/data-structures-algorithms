# Counting Operations

## Summary

- Comparing code based on time has limitations.

- Instead, counting the number of simple operations performed by a computer provides a more reliable comparison.

- Simple operations include multiplication, addition, and division.

- Regardless of computer specifications or time variations, the count of simple operations remains constant.

- It can be challenging to count operations accurately, but what matters is the general trend.

- Various methods exist for counting operations, but the focus should be on the big picture.

- As the input size (N) increases, the number of operations generally grows proportionally.
