# Intro to Big O Notation

## Summary

- Big O notation is a significant topic in the course, appearing in about 70% of the videos. It provides a system for classifying and comparing code performance, allowing us to determine the most efficient algorithm or solution among different implementations.

- Understanding Big O notation is important for technical interviews, working with large datasets, and optimizing code performance. It helps in discussing trade-offs between different approaches and identifying inefficient points in code.

- Big O notation allows us to have a precise vocabulary to talk about code performance and understand how it compares to other solutions. It provides a numeric representation of code performance, which is helpful for objectively evaluating and comparing algorithms.

- Being familiar with Big O notation is valuable when debugging code, as it helps identify potential bottlenecks and inefficient areas in the code. It allows us to optimize code for better performance.

- Big O notation is frequently asked about in interviews, so having a good understanding of it is beneficial for interview preparation.
