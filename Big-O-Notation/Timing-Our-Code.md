# Timing Our Code

## Summary

- Introduces a concrete example to compare two solutions to a problem: calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number (N). The first solution uses a loop to accumulate the sum, while the second solution involves a mathematical formula. (See timing-v1.js and timing-v2.js for the code.)

- Demonstrates the execution of both solutions using code snippets and explains the mathematical formula used in the second solution.

-Different factors to determine which solution is "better" are discussed, such as speed, memory usage, readability, and brevity. The focus in this video is primarily on speed.

- The use of timing functions to measure the execution time of code is explained, along with a demonstration using the two solutions.

- Highlights the limitations of manual timing and the variability of results across different machines.

- The challenges of accurately measuring time for very fast algorithms are discussed.

- The need for a more general way to evaluate and compare code without relying solely on timing is introduced.

- The concept of Big O notation is mentioned as a method that can provide a value to discuss the efficiency of code in general terms.
