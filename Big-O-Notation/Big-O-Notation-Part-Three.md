# Big O Notation: Part Three

## Summary

- It emphasizes focusing on the general trend rather than exact counts.

- Constants and smaller terms can be disregarded when simplifying expressions.
- Arithmetic operations, variable assignments, and accessing elements in arrays or objects have constant runtime.

- The complexity of a loop is determined by the length of the loop multiplied by the complexity of operations inside it.

- Examples of functions, "log at least five" and "log at most five," are provided to illustrate simplification.

- The first function has a linear complexity (O(n)), while the second function has constant complexity (O(1)).

- The importance of understanding and comparing different complexities is highlighted.

- A chart is used to visualize and compare various complexities.

- The aim is to comprehend the implications of runtime complexities for algorithm performance.
