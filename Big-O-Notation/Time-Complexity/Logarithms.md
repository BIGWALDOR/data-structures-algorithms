# Logarithms in Relation to Big O Notation

## Summary

- Logarithms are the inverse of exponential actions and are represented as log base a of b.

- Common logarithm bases include base 2, base 10, and base e.

- Logarithmic time complexity, represented as O(log n), is more efficient than linear time complexity (O(n)) or quadratic time complexity (O(n^2).

- Logarithms are used in searching algorithms, efficient sorting algorithms, and recursion.

- Big O notation provides a high-level understanding of algorithm performance, measuring the number of operations rather than precise timing.

- Big O notation is widely used in algorithm analysis.

- Understanding logarithmic time complexity helps in comparing and evaluating algorithms.
